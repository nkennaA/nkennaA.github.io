        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
         Hello, I am Nkenna. I am currently a junior at MIT, and I am 19 years old. I graduated from Davidson Fine
            Arts High School in 2017, and since then I have been accepted into programs such as Google's Computer Science
            Summer Institute, and I have worked two internships at Facebook for Software Engineering. Languages I have worked 
            with include Python, C/C++, Objective C and Java.
